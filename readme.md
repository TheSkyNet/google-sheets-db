##About 

Imagine giving a client a google spreadsheet, and the second they update that spreadsheet, the changes they made are automatically instantly reflected to your web application. Your web application's data is always a 1:1 mirror of the data on the google spreadsheet.

I think you'll like it. I really think the possibilities here are huge.

Check out a quick video demo:

See it in action. Update the spreadsheet and see how the results change! (This is just a digital ocean quick and dirty droplet server, so it may go down at any time)
